# Day92-Custom-Web-Scraper
A program that scrapes data from imdb website for top 100 Movies ranked and then searches data about them and saves it into a csv file.

Note: Normally its not a good idea to do something like this, it is much simpler and time saving to just use an api. But the main idea of this project is to learn something new.

Sites used:
For top 100 movies: https://www.imdb.com/chart/top
for movies data: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/date/2023-06-12/weekly/
